Add @WebResource to your @Entity to generate a standard REST binding.

This is similar to what EclipseLink provides (http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Release/2.4.0/JPA-RS/REST-API), but IMHO hides technology better (e.g. why should a client care about the name of the persistence unit).

TODO:
Dynamic generation at runtime.
Provide @Version as ETag.
Provide Timestamp as lastModified.
Support other that Long ids.
Support HEAD
Support OPTIONS, TRACE, others?

Add @WebResource to your @Entity to generate a standard REST binding.

This is similar to what EclipseLink provides (http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Release/2.4.0/JPA-RS/REST-API), but IMHO hides technology better (e.g. why should a client care about the name of the persistence unit).

TODO:
Sub-Resources?
Timestamp as lastModified.
Queries by prepared statements.
Dynamic generation at runtime?
pagination
HEAD
OPTIONS
TRACE (if it's necessary; see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html)
Binding for DAOs
